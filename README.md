# Memory-Game
This will be a memory game, that gonna randomize a set of pictures for a user
and every set of pictures have pairs that need to be paired by the user himself
and once the user detects the identical pictures they get removed or (shadowed => I didn't figure this part out yet)
#still working on the js script 


# {Day 1} ==> Working for the first day in this project I learned:
  --I have to create classes for elements even if I don't have their pairs (just to keep the probability of updating it easy);
# {Day 2} ==> While I was wondering how I would configure the js logic out I stumbled into a wonderful website (Webtips.com).
