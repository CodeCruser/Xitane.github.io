# Memory-Game
This will be a memery game when a script with Javascript gonna randomize a set of pictures for a user
and every set of pictures always have pairs that need to be paired by the user himself
and once the user detects the identical pictures they get removed or (shadowed => I didn't figure this part out yet)
#still working on the js script
